# Collective Adaptation Engine

This component implements a decentralized adaptation approach for Collective Adaptive Systems (CASs) composed by different ensembles (set of agents).
The adaptation process is triggered by a run-time occurrence, within the system, of an extraordinary circumstance, called issue, and the resolution of an issue is the outcome of the triggered adaptation process that sees roles, aected by the issue, adapt collaboratively and with minimal impact on their own preferences.

This component has been realized in the context of the [http://www.allow-ensembles.eu/](ALLOW Ensembles) FET (Future and Emerging Technologies) Project  by the [http://das.fbk.eu/](FBK-DAS) Research Unit.
